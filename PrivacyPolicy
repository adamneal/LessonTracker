Lesson Tracker does not collect, use, save, or have access to any of the users personal data. Any data inputted by the user is saved on the user’s device only. Lesson tracker may ask for the user to input a name, which is used only to distinguish lessons from one pupil to another.

Lesson Tracker may also ask for relevant information such as regarding a pupil’s theory test date, practial test date, eyesight check date, whether they need glasses, licence check date, or have any health conditions. This is only saved on the device and cannot be accessed by Lesson Tracker outside of the local application itself. The data asked for is only for use by the user to comply with the National Standard for Driver and Rider Training guideline as set out by the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency. The data other than name is optional and does not have to be entered by the user for the core functionality of the app.

The App may also access the Mail app but this is only to send a lesson report to the pupils and no information is passed to Lesson Tracker.

The data that is stored locally on the device will be immediately deleted as soon as the pupil is deleted from the students list.
